The Golden Gate Bridge is a suspension bridge spanning the Golden Gate strait, the one-mile-wide strait connecting San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean. The structure links the U.S. city of San Francisco, California to Marin County. It opened in 1937 and was, until 1964, the longest main span suspension bridge in the world.

The bridge is one of the most internationally recognized symbols of San Francisco and California. Its orange color was specifically chosen to enhance its visibility in the fog that frequently shrouds the bridge.
